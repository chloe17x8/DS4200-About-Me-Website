As of recent I have been in my biology project biology lab learning about different techniques
used in molecular biology such as PCR, gel electrophoresis and bacterial transformation. I would find it very interesting
to be able to apply data science techniques to the data that I collect in my research. For example, using statistical analysis to 
interpret the results of experiments. Additionally we are looking at c elegans as a model organism to study genetics and development.
And based off the data different data science techniques can be used to make a visualization that may be more complex. It can become
more interesting to see complex patterns outside of just bar, line and scatter graphs.

Because I am particularly interested in how AI has transformed the field of biology, especially in areas like genomics and drug discovery.
I think that it would be very fascinating to see how machine learning models can predict protein structures or identify potential drug candidates 
more efficiently than traditional methods. As well an create different and innovative ways to visualize complex biological data to make it more 
accessible and understandable for researchers and clinicians. Data science also allows visualization of large datasets, such as genomic sequences 
or clinical trial results.

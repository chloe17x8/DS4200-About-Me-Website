<h1>Welcome to Chloe's Website!!</h1>
<p>
Hi! I’m Chloe, a third year student at Northeastern University studying data science and biology. 
I built this site to share what I’m learning and creating. I’m fascinated by how data helps us 
see patterns that aren’t obvious at first glance, and how careful experimentation turns questions 
into evidence. In my classes and side projects, I work across statistics, visualization, and lab‑based 
biology. I love te blend of technology and biology. I think that in the future I would want to go into 
bioinformatics or computational biology, where I can apply data science skills to biological data.
</p>
<p>
Outside of class, I’m usually studying biology and learning more about the field of biology and how
tools such as AI have changed the space for understanding. I care about tools that are simple, 
ethical, and genuinely helpful to the people who use them. With AI there have been enormous progress
in this area, especially in medicine, drug development and genomics. If something here sparks your interest, 
please reach out and learning from others. Thanks for stopping by!
